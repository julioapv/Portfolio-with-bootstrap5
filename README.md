# Welcome to this portfilio webpage!

This is a practice project I made following the FreeCodeCamp course on Bootstrap 5.

It is a portfolio webpage where you can talk about who you are, what you do and showcase your projects as well as including a "contact me" section. The webpage is fully responsive.

I use the proposed layout but used a different color palette, icons and fonts.

Thanks to this project I am now able to use Bootstrap 5 with ease alongside CSS and HTML.

*I don't have any plans to update this repo adding JS or React. I will focus on building new and more interesting projects*

### Enjoy! :)
